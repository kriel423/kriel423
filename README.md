- 👋 Hi, I’m Aadil Kriel. I started out as a Civil Engineer and became intrigued by the world of programming. Since 2015, I've been on a journey of being a self-taught developer
and I've gained a few skills along the way. I am seeking to become a certified Android Developer in 2021 📱 as well as a Full Stack Web Developer 💻. 

- ✍ I am going to write my Android Certification Examination this year (2021) and hope to transition into the world of Software Development 👨‍🎓.

- 👀 I'm interested in developing great UX-focused websited and mobile applications.

- 🌱 I’m currently improving on my Android and JavaScript skills, and learning Python because the applications are insane (I've developed in Java before and feel like Python is
the all-rounder that is going to seal the deal in terms of getting employed).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing ideas that are focussed on Engineering - I have ideas at this point and once the skills are at the point I need them to be at, I 
am certain that I will be an asset within the developers circle.
